# homework_template

This is a basic template for your assigments. Notice that we have an Rproject for you to help with your file references, and two folders, one for data and one for graphics. 

A successful assignment contains all the data needed to replicate the graphics, the exact code used to create the graphics (it should call all relevant packages/libraries), and presend the graphics in a nice markdown document.
